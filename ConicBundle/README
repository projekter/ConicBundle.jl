This file tells you how to compile ConicBundle

(It does not explain how to use it, please read the Manual for this.)

It is assumed that
 - Linux (or Unix) is your operating system,
 - you have access to a sufficiently recent version of g++ (other C++ 
   compilers may work as well) having available  the standard template
   library (STL)
 - you are using gnu make (other make programs may have difficulties 
   with certain macros).

In the same directory as the README file you will find a

Makefile

In this Makefile the compilers are currently set to

CXX             =       g++
CC              =       gcc

If you want to use other compilers, you have to replace g++ and gcc 
by the appropriate names.

Choose one of the two compliation modes corresponding to a mode for 
debugging and an optimized mode without range and dimension checks.

MODE            =       DEBU
#MODE           =       OPTI

It is recommended to start with the DEBU mode first. 
Note, upon any modification of Makefile a full recompilation
will be initiated. 

The Makefile is set up to allow the use of distinct compiler flags for 
each (operating_system.cpu.compiler)-configuration. You will find a 
few examples in the Makefile; we illustrate the concept for a Linux 
system with an "x86_64"-cpu and compiler g++,

#--- linux.x86_64.g++ settings ---------------------------------------------------
DEBU.linux.x86_64.g++ =  -g -fPIC 
OPTI.linux.x86_64.g++ =  -fPIC -DNDEBUG -O3 -march=native -funroll-loops 
WARN.linux.x86_64.g++ = $(GCCWARN)
DEPD.linux.x86_64.g++ = -MM
LINK.linux.x86_64.g++ = -lm 
AR.linux.x86_64.g++   = ar
ARFLAGS.linux.x86_64.g++ =      cr
RANLIB.linux.x86_64.g++ =       ranlib
OPTI.linux.x86_64.gcc = -DNDEBUG -O3
WARN.linux.x86_64.gcc = $(GCCWARN)
DEBU.linux.x86_64.gcc =         -g 
DEPD.linux.x86_64.gcc = -MM
LINK.linux.x86_64.gcc = -lm

These have the following purpose:
 - DEBU.*.*.* collects flags that should be switched on for debug mode.
 - OPTI.*.*.* collects flag used when optimizing.
 - WARN.*.*.* collects flags for warnings during compilation.
 - DEPD.*.*.* specifies the flag that forces the compiler to output a 
      list of header files that the current file depends on. This is 
      needed for automatic generation of dependencies in the Makefile.
 - LINK.*.*.* collects options to be used in linking.
 - AR.*.*.* gives the program building the archive for the library.
 - ARFLAGS.*.*.* collects options for the archive program.
 - RANLIB.*.*.* gives the program building the index to the library.

You may have to generate your own set if your configuration is not 
present. To find out your configuration simply plug in your compiler 
at CXX and run (gnu) make. Besides printing a lot of nonsense, make 
will create a subdirectory "<mode>.<os>.<cpu>.<CXX>". The last three 
terms of the subdirectory give you the names you have to use in order
to add your options in the Makefile as in the example above.

After having adapted the Makefile to your needs run make by typing

 make

After this you should find the library at

 lib/libcb.a

and some small example programs showing the use of the ConicBundle 
interfaces,

 t_c
 t_cxx
 t_mat

generated from the files

 c_main.c
 cxx_main.cxx
 mat_main.cxx

If you only plan to use the standard C or C++ interfaces, then all 
headers that you need can be found in the subdirectory include

 include/cb_cinterface.h
 include/CBSolver.hxx

If you plan to use the full interface with matrix classes, you will 
certainly need the subdirectory CBsources (with the main interface 
MatCBsolver.hxx) and most likely the subdirectories Matrix and 
Tools, as well.

The starting point for the html Manual is

  html/index.html

Much success!
